                            <li>Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12 colored discs. </li>
                            <li>Yellow moves first. Players then alternate moves.</li>
                            <li>Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).</li>
                            <li>A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.</li>
                            <li>A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, that player must continue to capture all pieces until there are no more options.</li>
                            <li>When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.</li>
                            <li>When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king.</li>
                            <li>Kings are limited to moving diagonally, but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)</li>
                            <li>Kings may combine jumps in several directions -- forward and backward -- on the same turn. Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).</li>
                            <li>A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. </li>
